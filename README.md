config_files
============

My linux config files, mostly used in CygWin for now.

Installation
============
```
git clone git@github.com:marthinsen/config_files.git .dotfiles
make -C .dotfiles
```
This will copy your old config files into *.bak as well as making soft links into the files in this directory

Powerline fonts
===============
I use this patched version of Consolas: https://github.com/Znuff/consolas-powerline
